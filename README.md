# Summary

UD Komi-Zyrian Lattice is a treebank of written standard Komi-Zyrian. 

# Introduction

The treebank contains continuous texts in written Komi-Zyrian language. The data is all from openly available sources. One of the larger segments come from Lev Uspenskiy's book *Нёль боевӧй случай* (URN http://urn.fi/URN:NBN:fi-fe2014102045428), which was digitalized in the National Library of Finland's [Fenno-Ugrica](https://fennougrica.kansalliskirjasto.fi/) project, and Ivan Belyx's short story which was released into [Komi Nebögain online library](http://komikyv.org) by the author himself in 2013. Some articles from newspaper [Выль туйӧд's 1939 number 67](http://urn.fi/URN:NBN:fi-fe201802013020) have also been included as complete texts. Several other books from Fenno-Ugrica collection are used for individual examples, and those are marked with the tag `-ind`, to distinguish them from running text. Complete list of used sources with additional informartion and further links is available [as a CSV file]https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_Komi_Zyrian-Lattice/blob/dev/not-to-release/meta.csv).
